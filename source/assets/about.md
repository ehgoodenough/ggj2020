### The Assets Directory ###

This is the directory of static assets like
images, sounds, music, fonts and more.

All of the files under this directory should
be non-code files, capable of being lazy-loaded
from a remote storage bucket in the cloud. Until
then though, we'll host them locally.

Our build system supports png, jpg, gif, svg,
ttf, woff, woff2, eot, mp3, wav, and ogg.
