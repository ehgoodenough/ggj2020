### The Models Directory ###

This is where the magic happens!!

This is the directory of modeled business
logic, encapsulated across a handful of
different classes.

For the top-level file, check out `Index.js`,
responsible for navigation, settings, and
instantiating the `Game.js` when the players
click on the play button from the title screen.
