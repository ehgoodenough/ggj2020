### The Data Directory ###

This is the directory of magic numbers: maps
of different levels, lists of different enemies,
text for metadata and favorite colors.

This raw data is passed into the models, which
wrap the json data with js classes, effectively
extending the plain data into smart data.

Most of the files in this directory are json,
csv, or xml, but you'll sometimes see some js.

For the top-level file, check out `index.json`.
